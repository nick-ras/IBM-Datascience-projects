The present address (URL) is a permanent link to this revision, which may differ significantly from the current revision.Revision as of 11:39, 9 June 2021 by C-randles (talk | contribs) (cite refs)(diff) ← Previous revision | Latest revision (diff) | Newer revision → (diff)\\nWikimedia list article\\n\\n\\nLeft to right: Falcon 9 v1.0, v1.1, v1.2 \"Full Thrust\", Falcon 9 Block 5, Falcon Heavy, and Falcon Heavy Block 5.\\nSince June 2010, rockets from the Falcon 9 family have been launched 408 times, with 405 full mission successes, one partial failure and one total loss of spacecraft. In addition, one rocket and its payload were destroyed on the launch pad during the fueling process before a static fire test.\\nDesigned and operated by private manufacturer SpaceX, the Falcon 9 rocket family includes the retired versions Falcon 9 v1.0, v1.1, and v1.2 \"Full Thrust\" Block 1 to 4, along with the currently active Block 5 evolution. Falcon Heavy is a heavy-lift derivative of Falcon 9, combining a strengthened central core with two Falcon 9 first stages as side boosters.[1]\\nThe Falcon design features reusable first-stage boosters, which land either on a ground pad near the launch site or on a drone ship at sea.[2] In December 2015, Falcon 9 became the first rocket to land propulsively after delivering a payload to orbit.[3] This achievement is expected to significantly reduce launch costs.[4] Falcon family core boosters have successfully landed 369 times in 381 attempts. A total of 43 boosters have flown multiple missions, with a record of ten missions by the same booster.\\nFalcon 9\\'s typical missions include cargo delivery and crewed flights to the International Space Station (ISS) with the Dragon and Dragon 2 capsules, launch of communications satellites and Earth observation satellites to geostationary transfer orbits (GTO), and low Earth orbits (LEO), some of them at polar inclinations. The heaviest payload launched to a LEO are a batch of 60 Starlink satellites weighing a total 15,600\\xa0kg (34,400\\xa0lb) which SpaceX flies regularly, to a roughly 290\\xa0km (180\\xa0mi) orbit.[5] The heaviest payload launched to a geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) was Intelsat 35e with 6,761\\xa0kg (14,905\\xa0lb).[a] Launches to higher orbits have included the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) probe to the Sun–Earth Lagrange point L1, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) space telescope on a lunar flyby trajectory, and the Falcon Heavy test flight which launched Elon Musk\\'s Tesla Roadster into a heliocentric orbit extending beyond the orbit of Mars.\\n\\n\\nLaunch statistics\\nRockets from the Falcon 9 family have been launched 408 times over 14\\xa0years, resulting in 405 full mission successes (99%), one partial success (SpaceX CRS-1 delivered its cargo to the International Space Station (ISS), but a secondary payload was stranded in a lower-than-planned orbit), and one failure (the SpaceX CRS-7 spacecraft was lost in flight). Additionally, one rocket and its payload Amos-6 were destroyed before launch in preparation for an on-pad static fire test.\\nThe first rocket version Falcon 9 v1.0 was launched five times from June 2010 to March 2013, its successor Falcon 9 v1.1 15 times from September 2013 to January 2016, and the latest upgrade Falcon 9 Full Thrust 377 times from December 2015 to present, 41  of which  using a re-flown first stage booster. Falcon Heavy was launched once in February 2018, incorporating two refurbished first stages as side boosters, and then again in April and June 2019, the June 2019 flight reusing the side booster from the previous flight. The final \"Block 4\" booster to be produced was flown in April 2018, and the first Block 5 version in May 2018. While Block 4 boosters were only flown twice and required several months of refurbishment, Block 5 versions are designed to sustain 10 flights with just inspections.[6]\\nThe rocket\\'s first-stage boosters landed successfully in 369 of 381 attempts (97%), with 344 out of 349 (99%) for the Block 5 version.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRocket configurations\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\n10\\n\\n15\\n\\n20\\n\\n25\\n\\n30\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'10\\n\\n\\'11\\n\\n\\'12\\n\\n\\'13\\n\\n\\'14\\n\\n\\'15\\n\\n\\'16\\n\\n\\'17\\n\\n\\'18\\n\\n\\'19\\n\\n\\'20\\n\\n\\'21\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 Falcon 9 v1.0\\n\\xa0 Falcon 9 v1.1\\n\\xa0 Falcon 9 Full Thrust\\n\\xa0 Falcon 9 FT (reused)\\n\\xa0 Falcon 9 Block 5\\n\\xa0 Falcon 9 B5 (reused)\\n\\xa0 Falcon Heavy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLaunch sites\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\n10\\n\\n15\\n\\n20\\n\\n25\\n\\n30\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'10\\n\\n\\'11\\n\\n\\'12\\n\\n\\'13\\n\\n\\'14\\n\\n\\'15\\n\\n\\'16\\n\\n\\'17\\n\\n\\'18\\n\\n\\'19\\n\\n\\'20\\n\\n\\'21\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 CCSFS, SLC-40\\n\\xa0 KSC, LC-39A\\n\\xa0 VAFB, SLC-4E\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLaunch outcomes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\n20\\n\\n30\\n\\n40\\n\\n50\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'10\\n\\n\\'11\\n\\n\\'12\\n\\n\\'13\\n\\n\\'14\\n\\n\\'15\\n\\n\\'16\\n\\n\\'17\\n\\n\\'18\\n\\n\\'19\\n\\n\\'20\\n\\n\\'21\\n\\n\\'22\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 Loss before launch\\n\\xa0 Loss during flight\\n\\xa0 Partial failure\\n\\xa0 Success (commercial and government)\\n\\xa0 Success (Starlink)\\n\\xa0 Planned (commercial and government)\\n\\xa0 Planned (Starlink)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBooster landings\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\n10\\n\\n15\\n\\n20\\n\\n25\\n\\n30\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'10\\n\\n\\'11\\n\\n\\'12\\n\\n\\'13\\n\\n\\'14\\n\\n\\'15\\n\\n\\'16\\n\\n\\'17\\n\\n\\'18\\n\\n\\'19\\n\\n\\'20\\n\\n\\'21\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 Ground-pad failure\\n\\xa0 Drone-ship failure\\n\\xa0 Ocean test failure[i]\\n\\xa0 Parachute test failure[ii]\\n\\xa0 Ground-pad success\\n\\xa0 Drone-ship success\\n\\xa0 Ocean test success[iii]\\n\\xa0 No attempt\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n^ Controlled descent; ocean touchdown control failed; no recovery\\n\\n^ Passive reentry failed before parachute deployment\\n\\n^ Controlled descent; soft vertical ocean touchdown; no recovery\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPast launches\\n2010 to 2013\\n\\n\\nFlight No.\\n\\nDate andtime (UTC)\\n\\nVersion,Booster [b]\\n\\nLaunch site\\n\\nPayload[c]\\n\\nPayload mass\\n\\nOrbit\\n\\nCustomer\\n\\nLaunchoutcome\\n\\nBoosterlanding\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n4 June 2010,18:45\\n\\nF9 v1.0[7]B0003.1[8]\\n\\nCCAFS,SLC-40\\n\\nDragon Spacecraft Qualification Unit\\n\\n\\n\\nLEO\\n\\nSpaceX\\n\\nSuccess\\n\\nFailure[9][10](parachute)\\n\\n\\nFirst flight of Falcon 9 v1.0.[11] Used a boilerplate version of Dragon capsule which was not designed to separate from the second stage.(more details below) Attempted to recover the first stage by parachuting it into the ocean, but it burned up on reentry, before the parachutes even deployed.[12]\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n8 December 2010,15:43[13]\\n\\nF9 v1.0[7]B0004.1[8]\\n\\nCCAFS,SLC-40\\n\\nDragon demo flight C1(Dragon C101)\\n\\n\\n\\nLEO (ISS)\\n\\n\\nNASA (COTS)\\nNRO\\n\\n\\nSuccess[9]\\n\\nFailure[9][14](parachute)\\n\\n\\nMaiden flight of Dragon capsule, consisting of over 3 hours of testing thruster maneuvering and reentry.[15] Attempted to recover the first stage by parachuting it into the ocean, but it disintegrated upon reentry, before the parachutes were deployed.[12] (more details below) It also included two CubeSats,[16] and a wheel of Brouère cheese.\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\n22 May 2012,07:44[17]\\n\\nF9 v1.0[7]B0005.1[8]\\n\\nCCAFS,SLC-40\\n\\nDragon demo flight C2+[18](Dragon C102)\\n\\n525\\xa0kg (1,157\\xa0lb)[19]\\n\\nLEO (ISS)\\n\\nNASA (COTS)\\n\\nSuccess[20]\\n\\nNo attempt\\n\\n\\nDragon spacecraft demonstrated a series of tests before it was allowed to approach the International Space Station.

The capsule was recovered off the coast of Mexico[811] and then placed on display at SpaceX headquarters.[812]\\nThe remaining objectives of the NASA COTS qualification program were combined into a single Dragon C2+ mission,[813] on the condition that all milestones would be validated in space before berthing Dragon to the ISS. The Dragon capsule was propelled to orbit on 22 May, and for the next days tested its positioning system, solar panels, grapple fixture, proximity navigation sensors, and its rendezvous capabilities at safe distances. After a final hold position a 9\\xa0m (30\\xa0ft) away from the Harmony docking port on 25 May, it was grabbed with the station\\'s robotic arm (Canadarm2), and eventually, the hatch was opened on 26 May. It was released on 31 May and successfully completed all the return procedures,[814] and the recovered Dragon C2+ capsule is now on display at Kennedy Space Center.[815]  Falcon 9 and Dragon thus became the first fully commercially developed launcher to deliver a payload to the International Space Station, paving the way for SpaceX and NASA to sign the first Commercial Resupply Services agreement for 12 cargo deliveries.[816]\\n\\nCRS-1\\nMain article: SpaceX CRS-1\\nDragon CRS-1 berthed to the International Space Station (ISS) on 14 October 2012, photographed from the Cupola.\\nFirst operational cargo resupply mission to ISS, the fourth flight of Falcon 9, was launched on 7 October 2012. At 76 seconds after liftoff, engine 1 of the first stage suffered a loss of pressure which caused an automatic shutdown of that engine, but the remaining eight first-stage engines continued to burn and the Dragon capsule reached orbit successfully and thus demonstrated the rocket\\'s \"engine out\" capability in flight.[817][818] Due to ISS visiting vehicle safety rules, at NASA\\'s request, the secondary payload Orbcomm-2 was released into a lower-than-intended orbit.[26] The mission continued to rendezvous and berth the Dragon capsule with the ISS where the ISS crew unloaded its payload and reloaded the spacecraft with cargo for return to Earth.[819] Despite the incident, Orbcomm said they gathered useful test data from the mission and planned to send more satellites via SpaceX,[25] which happened in July 2014 and December 2015.\\n\\nMaiden flight of v1.1\\nMain article: CASSIOPE\\nSpaceX Falcon 9 v1.1 launch from Vandenberg with CASSIOPE\\nFollowing unsuccessful attempts at recovering the first stage with parachutes, SpaceX upgraded to much larger first stage booster and with greater thrust, termed Falcon 9 v1.1 (also termed Block 2[820]). SpaceX performed its first, demonstration flight of this version on 29 September 2013,[821] with CASSIOPE as a primary payload. This had a payload mass that is very small relative to the rocket\\'s capability, and was launched at a discounted rate, approximately 20% of the normal published price.[822][823][30]  After the second stage separation, SpaceX conducted a novel high-altitude, high-velocity flight test, wherein the booster attempted to reenter the lower atmosphere in a controlled manner and decelerate to a simulated over-water landing.[30]\\n\\nLoss of CRS-7 mission\\nMain article: SpaceX CRS-7\\nSpaceX CRS-7 disintegrating two minutes after liftoff, as seen from a NASA tracking camera.\\nOn 28 June 2015, Falcon 9 Flight 19 carried a Dragon capsule on the seventh Commercial Resupply Services mission to the ISS. The second stage disintegrated due to an internal helium tank failure while the first stage was still burning normally. This was the first (and only as of May 2021) primary mission loss for any Falcon 9 rocket.[93] In addition to ISS consumables and experiments, this mission carried the first International Docking Adapter (IDA-1), whose loss delayed preparedness of the station\\'s US Orbital Segment (USOS) for future crewed missions.[824]\\nPerformance was nominal until T+140 seconds into launch when a cloud of white vapor appeared, followed by rapid loss of second-stage LOX tank pressure. The booster continued on its trajectory until complete vehicle breakup at T+150 seconds. The Dragon capsule was ejected from the disintegrating rocket and continued transmitting data until impact with the ocean. SpaceX officials stated that the capsule could have been recovered if the parachutes had deployed; however, the Dragon software did not include any provisions for parachute deployment in this situation.[95] Subsequent investigations traced the cause of the accident to the failure of a strut that secured a helium bottle inside the second-stage LOX tank. With the helium pressurization system integrity breached, excess helium quickly flooded the tank, eventually causing it to burst from overpressure.[825][826] NASA\\'s independent accident investigation into the loss of SpaceX CRS-7 found that the failure of the strut which led to the breakup of the Falcon-9 represented a design error. Specifically, that industrial grade stainless steel had been used in a critical load path under cryogenic conditions and flight conditions, without additional part screening, and without regard to manufacturer recommendations.[827]\\n\\nFull-thrust version and first booster landings\\nMain articles: Falcon 9 flight 20 and SpaceX CRS-8\\nFalcon 9 Flight 20 historic first-stage landing at CCAFS Landing Zone 1, 22 December 2015\\nAfter pausing launches for months, SpaceX launched on 22 December 2015, the highly anticipated return-to-flight mission after the loss of CRS-7. This launch inaugurated a new Falcon 9 Full Thrust version (also initially termed Block 3[820]) of its flagship rocket featuring increased performance, notably thanks to subcooling of the propellants. After launching a constellation of 11 Orbcomm-OG2 second-generation satellites,[828] the first stage performed a controlled-descent and landing test for the eighth time, SpaceX attempted to land the booster on land for the first time. It managed to return the first stage successfully to the Landing Zone 1 at Cape Canaveral, marking the first successful recovery of a rocket first stage that launched a payload to orbit.[829] After recovery, the first stage booster performed further ground tests and then was put on permanent display outside SpaceX\\'s headquarters in Hawthorne, California.[98]\\nOn 8 April 2016, SpaceX delivered its commercial resupply mission to the International Space Station marking the return-to-flight of the Dragon capsule, after the loss of CRS-7. After separation, the first-stage booster slowed itself with a boostback maneuver, re-entered the atmosphere, executed an automated controlled descent and landed vertically onto the drone ship Of Course I Still Love You, marking the first successful landing of a rocket on a ship at sea.[830] This was the fourth attempt to land on a drone ship, as part of the company\\'s experimental controlled-descent and landing tests.[831]\\n\\nLoss of Amos-6 on the launch pad\\nMain article: Amos-6\\nOn 1 September 2016, the 29th Falcon 9 rocket exploded on the launchpad while propellant was being loaded for a routine pre-launch static fire test. The payload, Israeli satellite Amos-6, partly commissioned by Facebook, was destroyed with the launcher.[832] On 2 January 2017, SpaceX released an official statement indicating that the cause of the failure was a buckled liner in several of the COPV tanks, causing perforations that allowed liquid and/or solid oxygen to accumulate underneath the COPVs carbon strands, which were subsequently ignited possibly due to friction of breaking strands.[149]\\n\\nInaugural reuse of the first stage\\nMain article: SES-10\\nOn March 30, 2017, Flight 32 launched the SES-10 satellite with the first-stage booster B1021, which had been previously used for the CRS-8 mission a year earlier. The stage was successfully recovered a second time and was retired and put on display at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.[833]\\n\\nZuma launch controversy\\nMain article: Zuma (satellite)\\nZuma was a classified United States government satellite and was developed and built by Northrop Grumman at an estimated cost of US$3.5 billion.[834] Its launch, originally planned for mid-November 2017, was postponed to 8 January 2018 as fairing tests for another SpaceX customer were assessed. Following a successful Falcon 9 launch, the first-stage booster landed at LZ-1.[242] Unconfirmed reports suggested that the Zuma spacecraft was lost,[243] with claims that either the payload failed following orbital release, or that the customer-provided adapter failed to release the satellite from the upper stage, while other claims argued that Zuma was in orbit and operating covertly.[243] SpaceX\\'s COO Gwynne Shotwell stated that their Falcon 9 \"did everything correctly\" and that \"Information published that is contrary to this statement is categorically false\".[243] A preliminary report indicated that the payload adapter, modified by Northrop Grumman after purchasing it from a subcontractor, failed to separate the satellite from the second stage under the zero gravity conditions.[835][834] Due to the classified nature of the mission, no further official information is expected.[243]\\n\\nFalcon Heavy test flight\\nMain article: Falcon Heavy test flight\\nLiftoff of Falcon Heavy on its maiden flight (left) and its two side-boosters landing at LZ-1 and LZ-2 a few minutes later (right)\\nThe maiden launch of the Falcon Heavy occurred on February 6, 2018, marking the launch of the most powerful rocket since the Space Shuttle, with a theoretical payload capacity to low Earth orbit more than double the Delta IV Heavy.[836][837] Both side boosters landed nearly simultaneously after a ten-minute flight. The central core failed to land on a floating platform at sea.[261] The rocket carried a car and a mannequin to an eccentric heliocentric orbit that reaches further than aphelion of Mars.[838]\\n\\nMaiden flight Crew Dragon and first crewed flight\\nMain articles: Crew Dragon Demo-1 and Crew Dragon Demo-2\\nOn March 2, 2019, SpaceX launched its first orbital flight of Dragon 2 (Crew Dragon). It was an uncrewed mission to the International Space Station. The Dragon contained a mannequin named Ripley which was equipped with multiple sensors to gather data about how a human would feel during the flight. Along with the mannequin was 300 pounds of cargo of food and other supplies.[839] Also on board was Earth plush toy referred to as a \\'Super high tech zero-g indicator\\'.[840] The toy became a hit with astronaut Anne McClain who showed the plushy on the ISS each day[841] and also deciding to keep it on board to experience the crewed SpX-DM2.\\nThe Dragon spent six days in space including five docked to the International Space Station. During the time, various systems were tested to make sure the vehicle was ready for US astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken to fly in it in 2020. The Dragon undocked and performed a re-entry burn before splashing down on March 8, 2019 at 08:45 EST, 320\\xa0km (200\\xa0mi) off the coast of Florida.[842]\\nSpaceX held a successful launch of the first commercial orbital human space flight on May 30, 2020, crewed with NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken. Both astronauts focused on conducting tests on the Crew Dragon capsule. Crew Dragon successfully returned to Earth, splashing down in the Gulf of Mexico on August 2, 2020.[843]\\n\\nBooster reflight records\\nMain articles: Falcon 9 B1046 and Falcon 9 B1048\\nMost records  were set during launches of Starlink satellites.\\nOn 3 December 2018, Spaceflight SSO-A  launched on B1046. It was the first commercial mission to use a booster flying for the third time.\\nB1048 made the first fourth flight of a booster in November 2019, and the fifth flight in March 2020, but the booster was lost during re-entry. \\nB1049 was the first booster to be recovered five times on 4 June 2020, six times on 18 August 2020, and seven times on 25 November 2020.\\nB1051 was the first booster to be recovered eight times on 20 January 2021. It was recovered for the ninth time on 14 March 2021.[844][845]\\nOn 9 May 2021, B1051 launched and landed for the tenth time, achieving one of SpaceX\\'s milestone goals for reuse.[846]\\nBooster B1060 holds the record for fastest  turnaround at 27 days.

Orbcomm requested that SpaceX carry one of their small satellites (weighing a few hundred pounds, versus Dragon at over 12,000 pounds)... The higher the orbit, the more test data [Orbcomm] can gather, so they requested that we attempt to restart and raise altitude. NASA agreed to allow that, but only on condition that there be substantial propellant reserves, since the orbit would be close to the space station. It is important to appreciate that Orbcomm understood from the beginning that the orbit-raising maneuver was tentative. They accepted that there was a high risk of their satellite remaining at the Dragon insertion orbit. SpaceX would not have agreed to fly their satellite otherwise, since this was not part of the core mission and there was a known, material risk of no altitude raise.\\n\\n^ Clark, Stephen (14 November 2012). \"Dragon Mission Report\".
